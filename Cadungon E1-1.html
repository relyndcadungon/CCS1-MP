		<h2>About myself</h2>
		<p>I am Relyn Grace D. Cadungon, a 1st year BS Computer Science in Silliman University. I am 18 years of age and from Canlaon City. Born on January 6, 2006 and my zodiac sign is capricorn. I wear glasses since grade 12 because of two reason; blurry eyesight and for passion (daw). I used to play Mobile Legends but I'm not that good. I use facebook for family and school purposes, Instagram for friends, and Discord to find new friends.</p>
		<p>I chose Computer Science because  it is an incredibly versatile and dynamic field that shapes modern technology, from artificial intelligence to software development. It's fascinating for many because of its ability to solve real world problems, improve efficiency, and create innovative solutions across industries.
